title: "Corporate Hiring Under COVID-19: Financial Constraints and the Nature of New Jobs"
subtitle: 
summary: "(with <a href=\"https://www.murillocampello.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Murillo Campello</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gauravkankanhalli.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gaurav Kankanhalli</a>) \n\n Big data on job postings reveal multiple facets of the impact of COVID-19 on corporate hiring. Firms disproportionately cut new hiring for high-skill positions, with financially constrained firms reducing skilled hiring the most. Applying machine learning methods to job-ad texts, we find that firms have skewed their hiring toward operationally-core functions. New positions display greater flexibility regarding schedules and tasks. While job posting levels show signs of recovery starting in late-2020, changes to job descriptions and skill profiles persist through early-2022. Financial constraints amplify these changes, with constrained firmsâ€™ new hires witnessing greater adjustments to job roles and employment arrangements."
