title: "Corporate Hiring under Covid-19"
subtitle: 
summary: "(with <a href=\"https://www.murillocampello.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Murillo Campello</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gauravkankanhalli.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gaurav Kankanhalli</a> \n\n Big data on job vacancy postings reveal multiple dimensions of the impact of Covid-19 on corporate hiring. Firms disproportionately cut hiring for high-skill jobs (*within-firm* downskilling). Financially-constrained firms scaled back high-skill hiring most, as did firms with workforces more adaptable to \"working-from-home.\" Applying machine learning to job-ad texts, we show that firms have skewed hiring towards operationally-core positions. New positions take longer to fill, displaying greater flexibility regarding schedules, tasks, and requirements. Financing constraints amplify pandemic-induced changes to the nature of positions firms seek to fill, with constrained firms' new hires witnessing larger adjustments to job roles and employment arrangements."
