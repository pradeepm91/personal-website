I am an Assistant Professor of  Finance at the A. B. Freeman School of Business at Tulane University. I obtained my PhD in Finance from the SC Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University.  I am an empirical corporate finance researcher with a focus on financial contracting and, particularly, its applications in intermediation and labor markets. My research explores the effects of financial and real frictions on intermediation and firms' human capital.
