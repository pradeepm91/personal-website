I am a PhD student in Finance at the SC Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University. Prior to my PhD I worked for Deutsche Bank in wholesale CDS, CDO and CLO trading. I obtained an M.Sc. in Financial Economics from the University of Oxford (2014) and a B.Tech. (Hons.) from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (2013). My research is in empirical corporate finance with a focus on bank and corporate liquidity policies, and corporate hiring decisions. 

I am on the 2021-2022 job market and will be available for interviews at the FMA meetings in Denver in October 2021.
